Changes in version 1.16:

The substitute command no longer complains about an 'Infinite substitution
loop' with a substitution like 's/^/#/g'. (Reported by Bjoern Wibben).

The length limit of the prompt string has been removed.
(Reported by Tim Chase).

It has been documented in the manual that extended regular expression
operators may be unavailable depending on the particular regex
implementation in the system running ed. (Reported by Brian Zwahr).

Several fixes and improvements have been made to the manual.
